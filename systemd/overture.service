# overture.service
#
# The Overture service is the modern Onboarding app.
# It takes new users through an engaging flow.
#
# It is started at boot time right before the tty1 console is allocated,
# and only when multi-user mode is active - not graphical mode.
#
# Reason to work in multi-user mode only is because we do not have a new user account yet.
# Throughout the Onboarding flow, we start the X server as the new user, in the background.
#
# see the README file for grainer details.
